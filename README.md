Local Weather and Environment Aggregation Scripts

Uses some original source from:
https://github.com/wrbelfield/ws1001wxdata
https://github.com/sramsay/wu (maybe)

Right now this uses a combination of Python, Perl, and Go.
Hoping to standardize (eventually) and dump it into an influxDB
backend that Grafana can use for dashboards.

Personal Project!
